## About

This is a fictitious shopping page developed to put in practice the content learned about the basics of vue. There is stock control, cart, access at products by url, and a little bit about responsive pages.

## How to run?

It's needed to run over a web server, be it Apache, Tomcat or Nginx (they   
are just examples, you can use the one you prefer). If you try to run it just opening the index.html, it won't work. 

quick tip: You can run it with *live server* vscode extension.
